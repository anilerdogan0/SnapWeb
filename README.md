# SnapWeb
SnapWeb is a program that allows you to take screenshots of specific web pages at specific intervals. It can adjust resolution and zoom settings, and use cookies to provide personalized screenshots.

**SnapWeb requires Chrome to run. Don't forget to install Chrome before running it**

If you want to preserve your settings (time setting, links, resolution, zoom, etc.) for future use, you need to run the Python file named "SnapWeb.py".
You can run the following code to load the necessary Python libraries:
```
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
```
